To install Download the and  unpack the zip  chose the skins that you want use and change the skin name to the name of the vult module e.g. "Flanme_vintage.svg" to "Flame.svg" go to your vcv rack pluging folder (MacOS: Documents/Rack/ , Windows: My Documents/Rack/, Linux: ~/.Rack/ >> plugins/VultModules ) and remplace the file.

although I have the approval of Vult to distribute these skins, these are not part of the Vult software and are not maintained by vult, . You will have to restore them after every update. the vult logo is property of vult. please read the file "ARTWORK-LICENSE.txt" for more information.
